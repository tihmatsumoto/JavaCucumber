###### What is BDD?
Behavior Driven Development is a process to work in a collaborative fashion and to bridge the gap between business and technical people.
They are derived as multiple chunks with limited number of features for the development team. It is also important for documentation.

In BDD, requirements are called Acceptance Criteria. This are the SCENARIOS, and it is written in Gherkin language.
